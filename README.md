GUI BIRDS is an effort to create a user-friendly GUI (Graphical User Interface) for the school rocket teamâ€™s BIRDS (BYU-I Rocket Dynamics Simulator) program. Currently, BIRDS uses several input files, requires command-line execution, and outputs several .CSV files. This can be cumbersome for unexperienced users, since proper usage of BIRDS requires properly formed XML and CSV files, as well as knowledge of BIRDS two step simulation process, including their relevant commands and arguments. Finally, users are required to manually convert CSV files to graphs to understand the results of the simulation. Project: GUI BIRDS addresses all of this by providing an understandable, easy to use user interface that aids in creation of input files, operation of the BIRDS program, and reporting of BIRDS results.
